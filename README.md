Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-YOLOv8
About

The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) project uses YOLOv8 for detecting license plates from video footage. This project processes video files to extract and recognize license plates, making it useful for vehicle monitoring and tracking applications.
Features

    Video Processing: Extracts frames from video and detects license plates using YOLOv8.
    Data Interpolation: Fills in missing data points to smooth the detection output.
    Visualization: Generates visual output showing detected license plates with smooth transitions.

Usage

To use the ANPR system, follow these steps:

    Create a Python Environment: Set up a virtual environment for the project.
    Activate the Environment: Activate the virtual environment to install dependencies.
    Create Required Folders: Set up Src for input video files and Output for processed results.
    Install Dependencies: Install the necessary Python packages.
    Run Main Script: Process the video to generate test.csv.
    Interpolate Missing Data: Smooth out the data for consistent output.
    Visualize Results: Generate visual output from the processed data.

Technologies Used

    Python: Programming language used for scripting and processing.
    YOLOv8: Object detection model used for detecting license plates.
    OpenCV: Library used for video processing and image handling.

Installation

    Create a Python virtual environment.
    Activate the environment.
    Create Src and Output folders.
    Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
